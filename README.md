# Dimple Data

# Mass is objects that sync.

Dimple Data is a reactive data store with encrypted sync based on SQLite. 

- Plain SQL for queries, schemas, and migrations.
- Subscribe to query results to get updates when data changes.
- Sync via *any* S3 compatible endpoint. No other server support required.
- Sync data can be optionally encrypted with a pass phrase.
- Merge conflicts are resolved last-write-wins at the attribute level.
